                        «When the child was a child, it walked with its arms swinging. It wanted the stream to be a river, the river a torrent, and this puddle to be the sea. When the child was a child, it didn't know it was a child. Everything was full of life, and all life was one. When the child was a child, it had no opinion about anything, no habits. It often sat cross-legged, took off running, had a cowlick in its hair, and didn't make faces when photographed».

                        This year Wim Wenders' ode to Berlin «Der Himmel über Berlin» or «Wings of Desire» is turning 30 years old. As a new Berliner I re-discovered the places you can see in the movie. Using my hands I brought back the characters as a drawings. On my pictures below, you can see the angels and their everyday life in Berlin after 30 years, since detective Colombo visited the city.
