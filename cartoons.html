                        I’ve been making <a href="streetportfolio.html">street</a> and travel pictures since 2009, always trying to find a style to express my moods and feelings while walking down the street. Lately I decided to try out something new. I combined my passion for bad sketching with my professional photography.

                        I was born in 1990 in Leningrad, when it was still Soviet Union. I’m only a little bit older than my country – Russia. I graduated from the journalism department of the St. Petersburg State University, the same faculty, where such photographers as Yuri Rost, Ivan Kurtov and Alexander Taran have studied. During my studies I learnt about photography from my teachers in university, but also from my father, who used to have a little photo-editing studio at home when I was young.

                        <em>The object of my photography</em> – is the city as a living system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>The subject, that I’m trying to show</em> is the beauty of everyday urban life.
